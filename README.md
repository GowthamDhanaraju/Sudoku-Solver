# Sudoku-Solver
In this project I have coded a backtracking algorithm in C language to solve the code .Recursive backtracking algorithms have been chosen considering the time complexity and space complexity which has been analyzed in our project
.Several other approaches like Naiveâ€™s approach ,bit mark approach, cross hatching approach is also discussed in this thesis
Function definitions for creating recursion is defined and their implementation and application is discussed and additional functions which make the backtracking possible are also defined and implemented
in this thesis .
